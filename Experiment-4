[1] Write a Python program to count the number of characters (character frequency) in a string.

➤ Objective:
To count how many times each character appears in a given string using a dictionary.

➤ Python Code:
string = input("Enter a string: ")
ch_count = {}

for char in string:
        if char in ch_count:
                ch_count[char] += 1
        else:
                ch_count[char] = 1
print("Character Frequency:")

for key in ch_count:
        print(key, ":", ch_count[key])

➤ Output Example:
Enter a string: hello
Character Count:
h : 1
e : 1
l : 2
o : 1

➤ Explanation:
We use a dictionary to store each character as a key and its count as the value.
The loop increments the count whenever a character is found again.

[2] Write a Python program to remove duplicate elements from a list.

➤ Objective:
To create a list with unique elements by removing all duplicates.

➤ Python Code:

list1 = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]
unique_list = []

for item in list1:
        if item not in unique_list:
            unique_list.append(item)
print("List after removing duplicates:", unique_list)

➤ Output Example:
List after removing duplicates: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

➤ Explanation:
We check if each element is already in unique_list.
If not, we add it. This way, duplicates are skipped.

[3] Write a Python program to check whether a list is empty or not.
➤ Objective:
To determine whether a given list has any elements or is empty.

➤ Python Code:
list1 = []
if not list1:
        print("The list is empty.")
else:
        print("The list is not empty.")

➤ Output Example:
The list is empty.

➤ Explanation:
An empty list evaluates to False in Python.
So if not list1 checks for emptiness.

[4] Write a Python program to clone or copy a list.

➤ Objective:
To make an exact copy of a list using slicing.

➤ Python Code:

original_list = [10, 20, 30, 40]
cloned_list = original_list[:]

print("Original List:", original_list)
print("Cloned List:", cloned_list)

➤ Output Example:
Original List: [10, 20, 30, 40]
Cloned List: [10, 20, 30, 40]

➤ Explanation:
Using [:] copies the entire list into a new list.
This way, changes to one will not affect the other.

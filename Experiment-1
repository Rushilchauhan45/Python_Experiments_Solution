[1] How many important control structures are there in Python?
--> In Python, four main types of control structures are used to control the flow of the program:
➤ 1. Sequential Statements
The default mode of execution where statements are executed line by line.
➤ 2. Selection Statements (Decision Making)
These include: if, if-else, if-elif-else
➤ 3. Looping Statements (Iteration)
These include: for loop, while loop
➤ 4. Jump Statements (Control Flow Alteration)
break – to exit the loop
continue – to skip current iteration
pass – a placeholder statement

[2] elif can be considered to be abbreviation of
--> The keyword elif stands for: “else if”
--> It is used when we want to check multiple conditions after an initial if condition.

📌 Example:

A = 10
if A == 5:
    print("This is Five..!")
elif A == 10:
    print("This is Ten..!")   # This will be printed
else:
    print("Other..!")

[3] Which statement is generally used as a placeholder?
--> The pass statement is used as a placeholder in Python.

➤ Use:
It allows code to run without any action where code is syntactically required.

📌 Example:

for i in range(5):
    pass  # Placeholder to be filled later

[4] The condition in the if statement should be in the form of
--> The condition in the if statement should be in the form of a Boolean expression (i.e., returns True or False).

📌 Example:

age = 18
if age >= 18:
    print("Eligible to vote")

➤ Valid Boolean conditions include:
Comparison operators: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=
Logical operators: and, or, not
Membership: in, not in

[5] Write note on break statement
--> The break statement is used to exit a loop immediately, even if the loop condition is still true.

➤ Use:
It helps in stopping the loop when a particular condition is met.

📌 Example:

for i in range(1, 10):
    if i == 5:
        break
    print(i)

📌 Output:

1
2
3
4
➤ The loop breaks when i == 5, skipping all further iterations.

[6] Explain the use of range() in loop of python
--> The range() function is used to generate a sequence of numbers, commonly used with loops.

➤ Syntax:

range(start, stop, step)

start: Starting value (default is 0)
stop: End value (excluded)
step: Increment value (default is 1)
-------------------------
📌 Example 1:

for i in range(5):
    print(i)

📌 Output: 0 1 2 3 4
-------------------------
📌 Example 2:

for i in range(1, 10, 2):
    print(i)
📌 Output: 1 3 5 7 9
-------------------------

[7] Write a program to display
A
A  B
A  B  C
A  B  C  D
A  B  C  D  E

📌 Python Program:

for i in range(1, 6):
    for j in range(65, 65 + i):
        print(chr(j), end="  ")
    print()

📌 Explanation:

chr(65) returns 'A', chr(66) returns 'B', and so on.
Outer loop controls the number of rows.
Inner loop prints increasing alphabets based on row number.

📌 Output:
A
A  B
A  B  C
A  B  C  D
A  B  C  D  E
